          This is my final semester at CNM, My degree specialization is computer support specialist.
          I&#39;m planning on getting into the IT field, after I find a job I will most likely go back to school
          and get another degree in either cybersecurity or programming.<br/>As of late I spend my free time
          reading manga and learning bass guitar, I&#39;m excited to learn web tech as I can tell it will be
          an important skill for the future since I have plans to make my own videogames and things like git and javascript
          will come in handy.
